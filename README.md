# ProfStats Tool

This is the repository of the ProfStats tool created as a part of a hackathon organised by DevSoc of BITS Pilani Goa Campus.

## The problem

The students at BITS Pilani have the freedom to choose their own professors at the start of every semester. In order to choose the best professors for their courses 
in their semester, juniors take feedback from the seniors. But every senior has his/her own opinion which leads to a lot of confusion for the juniors. 

## How ProfStats helps

ProfStats is a tool which takes feedback from the seniors and shows the average rating provided by seniors on the preferences page. This clears the confusion which juniors have 
and makes the preferences of seniors clear.

## How to use

After signing in through Bitsmail on the homepage. The user can choose the required subject card on the next page. followed by that the user will be able to see the preferences 
given by seniors along with the rating of each professor.
